      <h4 style="margin-top: 50px;">My Contributions</h4>
      <p>Designed interaction, UI, and animation for <strong style="color: #d44825;">48</strong> quests, <strong style="color: #d44825;">7</strong> minigames, <strong style="color: #d44825;">3</strong> hubs, <strong style="color: #d44825;">2</strong> eReader projects end-to-end to make enjoyable experiences for K-5 students while satisfying pedagogical needs for improving their early literacy skills.</p>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 50px;">Platform:</h4>
      <p>Web, iOS, Chromebook</p>
<h4 style="margin-top: 50px;">Design Challenges:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Due to budget and deadline constraints, we had to design one version for all platforms</li>
        <li>Given that we were using React Native to make games, our design decisions were very restricted </li>
        <li>Our end-users were young kids who haven't developed technological prowess</li>
        <li>Student in their early ages develop core skills quickly, forcing us to have different product versions for at least every 2 grade levels</li>
        <li>Even in the same grade, student learn in different speed, so we had to make out product adapative to their level and pace</li>
        <li>We had to satisfy varity customers, not only to make it fun for kids, but also need to demonstrat the educational value to teachers and parents</li>
        <!-- <li>As a suplumental product for teachers, we need to acomendate the need of both letting teachers assign sepecific activities and allowing students to have their own adventure outside school</li> -->
        <li>In order to sell our products in certain state, we were required by law to make our product accessible and meet WCAG 2.0 AA standards</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 50px;">Product Overview (K-2 ver.):</h4>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 50px;">Summary</h4>
      <p>It was huge amont of work in short amont of time(2 years) with exciting challenges and great teammates. I learned a lot, I went...</p>
      <ul>
      <li>from surprised by how kindergartener interact with the mouse to understanding what they want to see in the digital world;</li>
      <li>from learning Game Design principle to being able to balence between fun and pedagogy;</li>
       <li>from researching how bodymovin work fundementally to establishing a (relatively) smooth dynamic web animation pipeline to produce around 50 quests;</li>
      <li>from understanding visual and interaction accessibility standard to knowing when and why it's okay not following it at some places in your product;</li>
      <li>...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There's so much more I could say about this big project, but there's only so little I can put in public. <strong style="color: #d44825;">If you're interested to know more, feel free to ask.</strong></p>
