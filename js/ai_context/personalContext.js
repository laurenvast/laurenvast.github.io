- Lauren has contributed significantly to the success of several high impact projects this year including:
    * The LO copilot project in which she played a key role by leveraging her front end and design skills in building out an experience within salesforce for Loan officers to gain the insights they needed on borrowers. This was an experiment led by the Design Tech & AI team and Lauren‚Äôs contributions helped prove the value of this feature and accelerate its implementation in production.
    * Listing performance dashboard - Lauren led the design of the first version of the listing performance dashboard that provides agents access to data on showcase listings to help them evaluate performance of their listings (views, saves etc) and ROI of the showcase subscription. This has been one of the top requests from showcase agents and in the first round of usability studies, several users were excited about the prospect of using these reports in listing presentations to earn new clients. Quote from Zara‚Äôs research: ‚Äúeveryone is loving the Listing Performance Dashboard!‚Äú
    * Agent Directory and Search  - Lauren led the end to end design of the Agent Directory and Search designs in close partnership with Lindsay who worked on Agent Profile and a diverse group of PEMD stakeholders including content, research, data scientists, SEO etc. This project kickstarted in February and has just launched to 10% of Beths in June and Lauren‚Äôs contributions played a huge part in getting this to production in such a short time while delivering high quality and keeping the customer as a north star.

Feedback and reviews from Colleagues at Meta:
- Lauren is a fantastic design partner and delightful to work with. Further, she has several "superpowers". When Lauren joined my team at Meta, She did extensive audits of prior work so that her additional designs push the product forward in new and better directions. 
- Further, despite giving Lauren an excessive amount of information, she was able to quickly learn and synthesize what had been done before. 
- Lauren multiplies the impact of UX research by corralling our XFN team to make important design decisions. She moves our team forward if the project begins to stall. I had been on the project for a few weeks before Lauren joined and it felt like we weren't able to progress until she gave the team direction. Not only does Lauren have characteristics that make her a good collaborator, she is also very good at the technical aspects of design. Her work is detailed, follows design themes, and explores important new directions. 
- Overall, Lauren has been an incredible collaborator and one of my favorite colleagues. I can give her my highest recommendation and am more than willing to answer any questions.Lauren is a fantastic design partner and delightful to work with. Further, she has several "superpowers".

Feedback and reviews from Colleagues at Uber:
- Lauren's a top-notch product designer who brings together technical knowledge and creativity. While on our team at Uber, she contributed to both important product features and a well-structured design system. She excels at collaborating with product managers and engineers, and with her inquisitive nature she asks questions that challenge her team towards the best solution. She's a joy to work with and a valuable asset to any team.Lauren's a top-notch product designer who brings together technical knowledge and creativity.

She excels at collaborating with product managers and engineers, and with her inquisitive nature she asks questions that challenge her team towards the best solution. She's a joy to work with and a valuable asset to any team.
- Quality: Since Lauren joined Uber and the team roughly four months ago she's already pulled together a comprehensive review of the sign up experience highlighting areas for improvement. To do so, she partnered with data scientist to get analytics for each step in the funnel and partnered with engineering to revive Hotjar functionality to get additional user insight. Lauren's review was well-researched and insightful. I'm excited to see her drive a lot of these improvements through to reality.
- Constructive Mindset: Lauren did a great job on pulling together a strong user experience for merchant tiered pricing. This was a complex project with numerous stakeholders and lots of important content to communicate to the merchant during a critical stage in their lifecycle. Lauren worked with Copy, Legal, PMM, and the Merchant Pricing PM to construct and iteratively improve on her designs. Overall, thought the Design portion of this project went incredibly smoothly thanks to Lauren's ability to respond well to constructive feedback and stay focused on the merchant and business priorities.
- Design Influence - The designs prepared by Lauren set the bar high for the XFN teams. Multi-page document upload is a classic example of how a user experience should be. The driver experience team called out that the design is impressive and would like to use them for their platform.
- Lauren has a great attention to detail and really thinks through the small details. This leads to a high quality product that works for all users, regardless of region, device type, etc.. Potluck v2 was a great example of this, where she thought about the mobile design thoroughly and added small touches like auto-scrolling when choosing a plan. These types of things keep our users happy and also improve conversion rate.
- Compared with other designer have worked with, Lauren collaborates with Data Scientist a lot more often - she is very proactive to leverage data insights to help her design. She always asks the right question related to different funnel conversion steps, so that she knows which interface she should focus on improving, and how she could improve it.
- Holistic view / championing the user / influencing roadmap: Lauren considers Lauren's work within the full context it'll appear, which is crucial particularly for SSU - in which individual projects fit into a single whole. Complementing that, Lauren is a constant advocate for our users, see our products through the lens of what's best for them, and championing the user with Lauren's cross-functional team. Lauren's work conducting the SSU audit / vision was particularly impressive: Lauren was able to identify issues across the whole flow, and successfully influenced the team towards taking on some of these issues as part of the roadmap.
- Attention to detail / influencing project scope: At the same time, Lauren is also pay attention to details and cases that others might overlook. Lauren's consideration of the various cases that may come up results in a higher quality product and streamlines implementation. For example, with SSU in POS, Lauren anticipated the need to handle multi-location support, which otherwise would have caused issues. Lauren successfully brought the discussion to the team and influenced them to scope in the work.
- Bridging engineering and design: This continues to be a strength of yours, which shows up in Lauren's feedback from Lauren's eng collaborators. Lauren is successfully factoring technical constraints into Lauren's design and collaborates with engineering on details like which components to use - which helps implementation speed and quality in a workstream in which there are lots of constraints.
- Flexible use of tools: Lauren make use of flow diagrams, wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, and prototypes with good judgment to communicate what Lauren needs to. Notably, Lauren's use of a flow diagram for illustrating the Google SSO and SSU in POS projects helped call out edge cases.
- Strong judgment informed by holistic thinking: Lauren excels at taking in learning about a problem, taking in all the inputs, asking the right questions, and making a good decision.
- Lauren's work on the merchant activation and onboarding Audit was truly impressive: Lauren came in fresh to the team and was given the broad problem of improving merchant activation and onboarding. Lauren digested a ton of information about the product and identified new ways of learning through analytics (digging into data with DS, restarting Hotjar) and research (talking to her parents!). Lauren ultimately created a thoughtfully prioritized list of possible improvement areas - which largely influenced the team‚Äôs H2 roadmap!
- Constructive mindset in stakeholder management: This is an extension of the first point - Lauren has also done a great job at taking in inputs from stakeholders. The Potluck project was especially high-profile and heavy with stakeholders - PM, engineering, PMM, legal, etc. - each with differing perspectives, goals, and constraints. Lauren did a great job at listening to each party's needs, asking great questions, and taking all the input into identifying the best design decision. The final Potluck design review stands out in my memory as very well run - Lauren was well-prepared with options and questions Lauren needed answered by different attendees, which led to a surprisingly smooth alignment process within a complex stakeholder situation.
- Bridging design and engineering: Lauren proactively uses her technical skills to bring clarity to complex design proposals (ex. prototyping the layout grid), identifying better ways to implement designs (text in SVGs), and proposing clever product approaches (magic links or PINs in merchant sign up).
- It's been a pleasure working with Lauren across projects to improve the way merchants sign up on Uber Eats. She lead on a SSU audit which was super thorough, insightful and well summarized, it enabled us to hone on key areas of improvement like the menu maker. I also really appreciate Lauren's williness to introduce the team to new tools like Hotjar that can improve the way we collect data about merchants and inform our design decisions. I've really enjoyed pairing with Lauren on the menu improvements and Potluck, we were able to ideate together, then diverge into focus time for our different craft areas before coming back together to present to the team. Lauren is also a champion of merchant needs in meetings with multiple stakeholders, she asks great questions, pushes to seek alignment and understand the root of feedback. The result are designs that are crafted and address merchant pain points while balancing the concerns of the business - amazing work.
- It has been a pleasure working with Lauren since she joined the team. She has been a great member. From my work with Lauren I would describe her with the following:
- Resourceful: When we worked on implementing/fixing Hotjar, Lauren helped me debug the issues and she offered a few ideas for why it might not be working. She also got me in touch with people who had institutional knowledge and were able to assist further. With mostly Lauren‚Äôs help, we got the Hotjar working.
- Timely feedback: Whenever I had a question or needed clarification with anything design related so far, Lauren was, without exception, quick and thorough with her answers.
- Thorough: Lauren is very thorough and meticulous when it comes to her work. When working on Subscription Fees in merchant activation, she regularly checked with me to see if I had all the specs correctly and she tested diligently and was quick with feedback. An example of her thoroughness is when I asked her to clarify what different fees meant and if some were included in others (there was some confusion around that in the beginning). She quickly explained but also made a couple of charts which really helped clear the confusion.

- Lauren is a deep and creative thinker, with great ambition and technical expertise to bring to her creative and lovely design aesthetic. She is so talented about thinking in terms of systems. She has lead the pack at finding ways to efficiently partner with developers to optimize workflows for both design and engineering. She has innovated on the process of animation and hand off to engineering to a beyond impressive point. Lauren is also so generous with her time, and is open to sharing the knowledge she builds with others on the team. She was instrumental in documenting our user experience. Her user flows are legendary! I admire her talent, her willingness to learn and to try new things and her constant push for quality and better/more consistent design for our users. 
- Lauren is one of the most innovative creative technologists I've ever worked with. I initially hired Lauren as a UI Designer to join our then-growing team of UX/UI designers for an ambitious and fast-paced project, which ended up consisting of nearly 50 mobile games for K-5 students and reporting for teachers. Lauren pretty quickly branched out to UX, animation, data visualization and coding, showing proclivity for optimizing software-related workflows, finding digital tools that improved design team's processes and inventing new ways of animating with code. Lauren's ability to process complexity and output an elegant solution is truly amazing. She has come up with pretty great off-the-wall ideas during our hackathons (ideas that inevitably end up being used by Product and Marketing teams), which she has designed and coded as well. Lauren's hunger for knowledge and self-improvement is awe-inspiring. She's constantly seeking ways to push her skills further, to know more, to attend conferences. Lauren is a hard worker who clearly loves what she does. Her warm and friendly disposition, as well as her sense of humor, make Lauren a joyful team member and a valuable mentor. She is always gracious with her time whenever a colleague needs help with something. Lauren is a rare gem. 
- I had the pleasure of collaborating with Lauren in the capacity of Creative Director on Amplify Reading where she helped to design the student experience over the course of two years. Lauren is a thoughtful and thorough designer, both inquisitive and self directed. She is interested in both applying research methods and open to exploration for the sake of learning something unexpected. She has a keen appetite for optimization in design workflow and applying design thinking directly in code. I would love to work with Lauren again in the future and believe she would enhance the design work and culture of any team lucky enough to have her.I had the pleasure of collaborating with Lauren in the capacity of Creative Director on Amplify Reading where she helped to design the student experience over the course of two years.

- Clarity: she presents her thoughts and process candidly, so we can all follow along.
- Fun: she very obviously loves what she's doing, and has a knack for making technical things delightful, which really rubs off on the team in all kinds of great ways.
- Lauren is a pleasure to work with. She fully understands the goals, problems, and requirements of projects she works on and creates thoughtful design solutions even when there are tough constraints. Lauren works well on both projects with tight deadlines and minimal scope as well as long-term conceptual explorations. Lauren asks great (and hard) questions. She can be counted on to expose areas of ambiguity, unclear strategy, and less-obvious (but important) use cases.

Creative technologist portfolio case study:

project: üé∂ Auto-Meow-Tone üé∂
Auto-compelete your melody in meow-tone!
keyword: CSS, JavaScript, Interactive music
my role: Creative direction, Technical strategy, UI design, Front-end development
Auto-Meow-Tone is a web app that uses cat meows to connect the user with a whole world of great music. The user enters three notes, and the app then autocompletes the melody, drawing from the many classic compositions and songs in the archive. Some kinds of music can be intimidating for kids, or for anyone not already familiar with the genre. With its easy-to-use keyboard, friendly interface and, of course, a lot of meows, Auto-Meow-Tone puts great music within reach.
This app was made with the Tone.js library. I partnered with an engineer worded in 3 days. I proposed the original idea, provided technical approaches for music processing, designed the look and feel of the site, and build the front-end interactions while my engineer parterner mainly worked on the algorithm and intergration with tone.js.

project:Your üëÉ Knows
Hands-free! Interact with the page using your nose.
keyword: CSS, JavaScript, Face track
my role: Creative direction Interaction design UI design Code-based prototyping
‚ÄúYour üëÉ Knows‚Äù is a web app that lets users interact using their nose. It utilizes the webcam to track nose movements, and allows people who may not have easy use of their hands to perform basic web interactions such as click, hover, drag, and drop.
This app was made with the creatability.js library. With this technology, the web experience could be made more inclusive to those with mobility issues.
It was a team of 2 people, an engineer and me. We collaborated on early concepts, I provided creative direction, designed the UI and interaction, developed front-end prototypes.

project: Animated avatar system
Creating dynamic character animation system
keyword: lottie, After Effects, JavaScript
my role: System architecting, UI design, Animation, technical prototyping
This is a part of Amplify Reading K-3 edition, a game for kids to improve their early reading skills. The magical beast, Curioso, comes in 3 differernt types, and kid choose one to be their companion throughout their learning journey. In the overall gameworld, we let kids customize their Curioso with the equipment they earned in the game.
This customized Curioso also appears in different quest locations, and animates based on the narrative. I developed the categories of the customizations and rules for layering, collaborated with illustrators to make sure the delivered SVG assets followed the spec I set, came up with dynamic color strategy, and created the state animations.

It was a huge success and the method and workflow I developed became the standard in the rest of the game development in the project.
