				<p><i class="ion-quote"></i>Lauren is a deep and creative thinker, with great ambition and technical expertise to bring to her creative and lovely design aesthetic. She is so talented about thinking in terms of systems. She has lead the pack at finding ways to efficiently partner with developers to optimize workflows for both design and engineering. She has innovated on the process of animation and hand off to engineering to a beyond impressive point.</p>
				<p>Lauren is also so generous with her time, and is open to sharing the knowledge she builds with others on the team. She was instrumental in documenting our user experience. Her user flows are legendary! I admire her talent, her willingness to learn and to try new things and her constant push for quality and better/more consistent design for our users.</p>

				<p><i class="ion-quote"></i>Lauren is a thoughtful and thorough designer, both inquisitive and self directed. She is interested in both applying research methods and open to exploration for the sake of learning something unexpected. She has a keen appetite for optimization in design workflow and applying design thinking directly in code. I would love to work with Lauren again in the future and believe she would enhance the design work and culture of any team lucky enough to have her.</p>

				<p><i class="ion-quote"></i>Lauren is a pleasure to work with. She fully understands the goals, problems, and requirements of projects she works on and creates thoughtful design solutions even when there are tough constraints. Lauren works well on both projects with tight deadlines and minimal scope as well as long-term conceptual explorations.</p>
				<br>
				<p><i class="ion-quote"></i>Lauren asks great (and hard) questions. She can be counted on to expose areas of ambiguity, unclear strategy, and less-obvious (but important) use cases.</p>
