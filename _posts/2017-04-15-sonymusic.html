<h5>Background</h5>
<p>Aimee Mann is an american singer/song-writer, and "Mental Illness" is her first album in five years. The goal of the splash page is to promote this new album. </p>
<div class="h-20"></div>
<h5>Inspiration</h5>
<img class="img-responsive" src="img/portfolio/mentalalbum.jpg" style="width: 400px; padding: 10px 0 10px 0; margin: 0 auto;"/>
<p>I took inspiration from her album artwork to simulate the layering effect, keep the tree and the goose as main elements and adjusted the layout to adapt responsively to the broswer size. The vibe of this album is really calming, so I wanted to give it subtal parallax effect that react to mouse position to have a sense of wind.</p>
<div class="h-20"></div>
<h5>Process</h5>
<p>The visual I got from the artist's team was only several flat images, so in order to create the parallax effect, I had to cutout the elements such as trees and the goose from the background into different layers in photoshop.</p>
<p>Also, in order to reduce the loading time, also for better responsive behavior, I decided to use CSS gradient for the background and layered with repeatable transparent textures to simulate the paper feeling of the physical album.</p>
