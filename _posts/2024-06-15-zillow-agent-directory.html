begining: Having a great real estate agent is critical for buyers and sellers to transact a home. I drove the redesign for Zillow agent directory that empowers home buyers and sellers to find and connect with a trustworthy agent who they feel confident to do the deal with. I shaped early definition, led the product design strategy with 1 year design roadmap and long term vision. Defined, crafted and delivered MVP that made CEO say “gorgeous”.
