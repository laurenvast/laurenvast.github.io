    <p>This customized Curioso also appears in different quest locations, and animates based on the narrative. </p>

    <h5>My role</h5>
<p>I developed the categories of the customizations and rules for layering, collaborated with illustrators to make sure the delivered SVG assets followed the spec I set, came up with dynamic color strategy, and created the state animations.</p>
        <div class="h-20"></div>

        <h5>Tech involved</h5>
    <p>After Effects/Bodymovin, HTML, CSS, JavaScript/lottie</p>
                <div class="h-20"></div>

      
  <h5>Defining rules</h5>

They can change the color of the character too, and some customizationâ€™s color will be dynamically changed based on the character's color.

  <p>Since no one in the team is aware of lottie's interactive animation capabilities, as the person who's experienced in both After Effects and front-end coding, I initiated the research and experimentation on lottie's layer control and segment playback. It was a huge success and the method and workflow I developed became the standard in the rest of the game development in the project.

  <h5>Prototype</h5>
    <p>I created this prototype to demonstrate the combination of different parts of the customization. Try picking an animal type, then click HAPPY. </p>
