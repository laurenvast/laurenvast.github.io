begining: The interactive book is a mini app in the Amplify Reading gameworld where elementary kids can read a book and practice their early literacy skills. This case study focuses on the challenges I faced when adapting the existing grade K-2 edition to fit the needs for grade 3-5 students.

	    <h5>Background</h5>
		<p>Back to 2018, we had developed an interactive book for grade K-2 students. In the interactive book, there’re challenge activities to test out their reading skills.</p>
		<p>Given the aggressive timeline and resource limitation, it was desired that we keep the core part of the existing interactive book the same while satisfying the needs for grade 3-5 students.</p>

	    <h5>Learning about the kids at grade 3-5</h5>
	    <p>In order to gain more empathy with kids at 3rd to 5th grade level, I, along with the design team, started reading childrens books that are written for 8 to 10 year old kids. We also played video games at the same level. Based on the grade 3-5 student profiles, the product team identified the needs to focus on.</p>
	    <br>
	    <p><b>Grade 3-5 students' primary needs for the interactive book:</b></p>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li>Grade 3-5 students need to engage with more complex book and activities so that they can feel more accomplished.</li>
	    		<li>Grade 3-5 students need to be able to read long paragraphs comfortably and work on the complex activities easily so that they can focus on comprehending.</li>

		<h5>Research: optimal reading experience</h5>
	    <p><b>Use single column view for better readbility</b></p>
	    <p>It was decided that we no longer need to support mobile optmization for them given the complexity of the tasks. I explored the idea of a single column view. I tested a couple variations on iPad and Chromebook with some typography gurus in the company, and we agreed on a font size considering that our users are kids who are still developing their reading skills. </p>

		<h5>Playtesting</h5>
	    <p>Even though the design looked good to me and the team, but we all knew that we needed to put it in front of the kids, whom we were designing for. I drafted a testing plan and went through it with the playtester to make sure the test plan was clear.</p> 
		<p>The playtesting team conducted 4 separated sessions with different students in the ideal grades. After reading through the testing report and watching the recording, I was able to identify some issues.</p>

		<p><b>Students didn't notice the activity icon in the top right corner when reading</b></p>
		<p>When they got to the end of the text (often just skipping forward) there were instructions to go back and answer the questions. That's when they started looking for them. </p>

	</div>
</div>

<div class="h-50"></div>

<div class="container" data-aos="fade-up">
	<div class="col-md-7" >
		<h5>Insight</h5>
	    <p>For the first issue, I thought that the cause was the position of the icon being too far away from the text. So I explored a couple ideas of making the anchor to be closer to the body text. </p>
		<p>For the second issue, my assumption was that because the layout had changed to have a lot more things that shifted their attention, the button with low visual contrast became hard to notice.</p>   
	</div>

<div class="h-50"></div>

<div class="container" data-aos="fade-up">
	<div class="col-md-7" >
		<h5>The solution</h5>
	    <p>I made the arrow to be more visible by giving more color contrast, and also made sure that the new contrast passes the accessibility retirement, along with several other elements. </p>

	    <p>But a couple month after releasing, we were able to see a 13% decrease of unanswered question on post-reading question types, and 10% decrease on all question types compare to K-2.
