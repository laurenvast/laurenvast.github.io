<p>Aimee Mann is an american singer/song-writer, and "Mental Illness" is her first album in five years. The goal of the splash page is to promote this new album. </p>
<h5>Inspiration</h5>
<p>I took inspiration from her album artwork, used the tree and the goose as main elements, and made the fixed parallax effect that react to mouse position to have a sense of wind </p>
<h5>Technology</h5>
<p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, photoshop</p>
