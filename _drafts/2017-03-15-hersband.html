      <h5 style="margin-top: 50px;">Background</h5>
      <p>Her's is a Pop band from the U.K., and the goal of the splash page is to promote their new album "Songs of Her's". </p>
      <!-- <h5>Inspiration</h5>
      <p>I took inspiration from their album artwork, used the tree and the goose as main elements, and made the fixed parallax effect that react to mouse position to have a sense of wind </p> -->
      <h5>Technology</h5>
      <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, photoshop</p>
